# My First Project - 404 Error Page

Welcome to my first web development project! This project features a custom-designed **404 Error Page** with an astronaut animation. I enjoyed working on this. The project uses basic HTML and CSS, along with some simple animations.

## Features

- **Custom 404 Page**: A visually appealing "Page Not Found" error page.
- **Animation**: The astronaut image smoothly moves up and down to add a fun touch.
- **Responsive Design**: The page adjusts to fit various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
- **Clean and Simple Code**: The project uses only HTML5 and CSS3 for an easy-to-follow structure.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the webpage structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling, layout, and animations.
- **Google Fonts**: Used for the "Geist" font to give the page a unique look.
